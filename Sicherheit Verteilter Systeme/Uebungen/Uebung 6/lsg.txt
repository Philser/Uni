Task 1
		
	a) symmetric encryption

		Authenticity
			- Exchange the key in person before establishing communication

		Confidentiality
			- If we assume that they key has not been stolen: No one else can decrypt messages

		Integrity
			- Add a checksum to every message
			- Calculate the hash of the unencrypted message
			- Encrypt message and hash and send both to receiver


	b) asymmetric encryption

		Authenticity
			- Sender sends a message with his Private Key, if people can decode message with the respective Public Key, sender is authentic
				(always assuming that the sender keeps his private key private)
			- Alternatively: Signature and Verify (tbc)	

		Confidentiality
			- Assuming that receivers do not give away their private keys, attackers cannot decrypt messages without knowing the PK

		Integrity
			-  Checksum, according to a)



Task 2
	

	2) 
		CSR = Asking a CA to sign your certificate

	4)
		Why do you see a warning?
			> because it's self-signed, not by a CA that is considered trustful by the browser

Task 3

	No error due to the CA cert being imported into the browser beforehand
